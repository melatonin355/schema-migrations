Managing Database Design with Schema Migrations: A Guide for Junior Software Engineers

Introduction: As a junior software engineer, managing database design can be a challenging task. Changes in the application's requirements can necessitate changes to the database schema, which can be complex and time-consuming to manage. This is where schema migrations come in. In this blog post, we will discuss how schema migrations can help manage database design and explore the main points related to schema migrations.

Main Points:

1.  Issues solved by migrations
    
    -   Changes in the application's requirements necessitate changes to the database schema
    -   Migrations help manage these changes by allowing developers to make incremental changes to the database schema without having to recreate the entire database from scratch
    -   Migrations make it easy to roll back changes if necessary, ensuring that the database remains consistent and predictable
    
2.  Migration files
    
    -   Migration files are scripts that describe changes to the database schema
    -   Migration files are typically written in SQL or a migration library's specific language
    -   Each migration file is associated with a version number, which allows migrations to be applied in order and rolled back if necessary
    -   Migration files should be kept under version control, just like the rest of the codebase
3.  Migration libraries
    
    -   Migration libraries provide a framework for managing database schema changes
    -   Popular migration libraries include Flyway, Liquibase, and Django Migrations
    -   These libraries typically provide a command-line tool for applying and rolling back migrations
    -   Migration libraries may also provide other features, such as automatic schema diffing, which can detect changes to the schema and generate migration files automatically
4.  Testing new migrations
    
    -   It's important to test new migrations before applying them to the production database
    -   Developers can test migrations using a staging environment or a separate test database
    -   Automated tests can also be written to ensure that the migration works as expected and doesn't cause any unintended consequences
5.  Applying and reverting migrations
    
    -   Migrations can be applied using a command-line tool provided by the migration library
    -   Migrations should be applied in order, starting from the current database schema version
    -   Migrations can be rolled back if necessary, using the same command-line tool
    -   Rolling back a migration should return the database schema to its previous state, without losing any data
6.  Schema vs. data migrations
    
    -   Schema migrations change the structure of the database schema (e.g., adding or removing tables, columns, or constraints)
    -   Data migrations change the data stored in the database (e.g., updating values, transforming data)
    -   It's important to distinguish between schema and data migrations because they have different requirements and implications
    -   Schema migrations can be applied automatically, while data migrations often require manual intervention to ensure that the data is transformed correctly
